            <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Cyber security is how individuals and organisations reduce the risk of cyber attack.
                Cyber security's core function is to protect the devices we all use (smartphones, laptops, tablets and computers), and the services we access - both online and at work - from theft or damage.
                
                It's also about preventing unauthorised access to the vast amounts of personal information we store on these devices, and online.</p>

            <h3 style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Importance of Cyber Security</h3>
            <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Cyber security is important because smartphones, computers and the internet are now such a fundamental part of modern life, that it's difficult to imagine how we'd function without them. From online banking and shopping, to email and social media, it's more important than ever to take steps that can prevent cyber criminals getting hold of our accounts, data, and devices. </p>

            <b><p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Internet of Things Security</p></b>
            <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">IoT security is the technology segment focused on safeguarding connected devices and networks in the internet of things (IoT). IoT involves adding internet connectivity to a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals and/or people. Each "thing" is provided a unique identifier and the ability to automatically transfer data over a network. Allowing devices to connect to the internet opens them up to a number of serious vulnerabilities if they are not properly protected.

                A number of high-profile incidents where a common IoT device was used to infiltrate and attack the larger network has drawn attention to the need for IoT security. It is critical to ensuring the safety of networks with IoT devices connected to them. IoT security, includes a wide range of techniques, strategies, protocols and actions that aim to mitigate the increasing IoT vulnerabilities of modern businesses.</p>

            <b><p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Cloud Security</p></b>
            <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Cloud security is a responsibility that is shared between the cloud provider and the customer. There are basically three categories of responsibilities in the Shared Responsibility Model: responsibilities that are always the provider’s, responsibilities that are always the customer’s, and responsibilities that vary depending on the service model: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Software as a Service (SaaS), such as cloud email.

                The security responsibilities that are always the provider’s are related to the safeguarding of the infrastructure itself, as well as access to, patching, and configuration of the physical hosts and the physical network on which the compute instances run and the storage and other resources reside.
                
                The security responsibilities that are always the customer’s include managing users and their access privileges (identity and access management), the safeguarding of cloud accounts from unauthorized access, the encryption and protection of cloud-based data assets, and managing its security posture (compliance).</p>

                <b><p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> Critical Infrastructre Security</p></b>
                <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Critical infrastructure security is the area of concern surrounding the protection of systems, networks and assets whose continuous operation is deemed necessary to ensure the security of a given nation, its economy, and the public’s health and/or safety.

                    Although the elements of critical infrastructure vary to some extent on the country in question, there are many commonalities among nations. In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has identified 16 sectors involving critical infrastructure, including energy, communications, transportation, financial services, food and agriculture.
                    
                    With the ongoing trends to M2M networking and the Internet of Things (IoT), devices in industrial environments are increasingly connected to the internet and capable of exchanging data. Despite the importance of these systems, for those that aren’t involved in IT (information technology), security is often inadequate.
                    
                    Industrial control systems (ICS) are ubiquitous in many areas of critical infrastructure, controlling everything from nuclear power plants and other utilities to HVAC installations, robotics and even prison cell doors. When many such systems were built -- even in environments that were somewhat automated -- computing resources and connectivity were limited. As such, cybersecurity was not considered a very serious concern.
                    
                    However, such systems pose a number of security issues.  For one thing, the fact that they are considered critical means that it is difficult to take them down for updates. Their limited computing resources may make it impossible to run antimalware. Furthermore, over 80 percent of such systems are owned and controlled by the private sector, which complicates any government efforts toward their security.</p>
