            <h3 style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">What is Enterprise Systems</h3>
            <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Defined as the large complex computing systems which handle large volumes of data and enable organisations to integrate and coordinate their business processes. Such systems normally are a single system central to organisations and ensure that information can be shared across all functional levels and management hierarchies.</p>
            <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> Enterprise systems are software that provides solutions to an integrated business organisation</p>
            <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Information systems that allow companies to integrate information across operations on an enterprise wide basis.</p>
            <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Web based information systems such as enterprise resource planning, supply chain management and customer relationship management all tie together all aspects of the enterprise so that it's operations, supply chain and distribution systems are coordinated amoung the core firm and relevant collabrators</p>

            <h3 style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Different types of enterprise systems</h3>
            <b><p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Enterprise Resource Planning</p></b>
            <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Enterprise resource planning systems are integrated business management software systems that are able to efficiently collect, store, manage and interpret data and information from a wide variety of different business processes. These include financial management accounting, human resource allocation, manufacturing and distribution operations.</p>
            <b><p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Supply Chain Management</p></b>
            <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Supply chain management or SCM systems are inter-organisational systems that can help a business execute supply chain transactions and operations, track inventory and manage supplier relationships more effectively and productively. The key objective of SCM systems is to enable businesses to efficiently track the flow of goods and services from suppliers to customers. Supply chain management systems can also automatically track when raw materials are required and send orders to suppliers autonomously.</p>
            <b><p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Customer Relationship Management</p></b>
            <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Studies have shown that CRM systems can increase a business’s overall sales productivity by 34%. Customer relationship management software can help your business collect, record and display customer data and information in a more systematic, productive and methodical way. It can also further analyse these statistics to draw valuable insights which can help your business improve customer relationships and overall consumer engagement.</p>

            <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">An excellent choice amongst the top CRM platforms in the market is Crust. The open-source CRM solution by Crust combines analytical tools, management systems, automation services and more under one platform.</p>

            <b><p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Knowledge Management System</p></b>
            <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Knowledge management systems can store and retrieve large amounts of knowledge to better perform organisational tasks. They can also be used to improve customer service drastically. 93% of customers are likely to make a repeated purchase with a company if they provide excellent customer service.</p>

            <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A knowledge management system can use its vast knowledge database to automatically answer customer queries in real-time. This will help improve your overall organisational productivity, as sales representatives can then use their time working on higher-level tasks instead of producing repetitive responses to customer challenges.</p>

            <h3 style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">How do Enterprise systems affect businesses</h3>
            <b><p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Store Business Data in a Useable Format</p></b>
            <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One of the most important aspects of improving the customer experience is having data stored in a way that can be easily analyzed. As the saying goes, “what gets measured, gets managed,” and the same applies for business data. Some examples of data that should be stored include customer order history, when and where they made those orders, and how long it took for those orders to be processed. A company’s ability to quickly retrieve this type of information in order to answer customers’ questions can go a long way toward improving customer satisfaction.</p>
            <b><p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Automate Customer Service Process for Employees</p></b>
            <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Using an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system can be a major benefit for companies looking to streamline their customer service experience. ERPs allow businesses to automate their customer service process, which helps ensure that each employee is giving customers a consistent experience, and also ensuring that back office functions are as streamlined as possible. Automation saves time, which can then be used towards efforts to respond to customer requests for product information and to forecast for new products. If employees are spending less time on tracking down a customer’s order, they can spend more time developing long-lasting, profitable customer relationships.</p>
            <b><p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Scale Avalible resources as needed</p></b>
            <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One of the lesser-known benefits of enterprise systems is their ability to scale the IT capabilities of a business up or down as needed. This means that companies that need to store additional data or require access to additional processing power can get that excess capacity using a cloud, software as a service (SaaS), or an Internet-based enterprise system instead of needing to invest in IT hardware. This also means that if less IT capabilities are needed for any reason, those same services can be scaled down. These flexible solutions allow a company to control costs while continuing to meet their customers’ needs.</p>
