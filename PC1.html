                <h2 style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" id = "CPU">Central Processing Unit(CPU)</h2>
                    <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The CPU, known as the brain of all computers, it is electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising of a computer programme, it performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling and inputs. CPUs are built by placing billions of microscopic transistors onto a single computer chip. One of the advancements in CPU techology has been on decreasing the size of transistors which allow for greater speeds, this is refered to as Moore's Law. </p>

                <h2 style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" id = "Input">Input Devices</h2><
                <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Input and Output devices are a major part of the computer. They are a type of hardware device that makes up the computer system. These allow the system to function properly with external help. They both deal with data but in different ways.

                The input allows the user to send data while the output completes the task related to the data. These all are auxiliary devices that connect to the device and complete all the tasks accordingly. Keyboards, mouse, scanners, etc are some of the input devices while printers, monitors, headphones, etc are some of the output devices. </p>
                    <h3 style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Keyboard</h3>
                    <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
                        The most basic input device to enter data on the system or any other device with the help of the keys is a keyboard. They establish a connection with the computer either by wifi or by a USB system. There are keys for everything – numbers, letters, characters, and functions.

                        The typing keys are A – Z and number keys till 09. The numeric keypad has 17 keys allowing users to perform different calculations. Then there are function keys for special computer features at the top row. The control keys have arrow signs on them allowing users to scroll on the page and select. Then there are special-purpose keys like space, enter, shift, etc.
                        
                        There are several types of keyboards according to geographic location but the most popular one is QWERTY. The go-to keyboard of the modern-day, even the Latin-based countries use this type of keyboard very frequently. The top six letters of the keyboard are qwerty, giving us the name of the keyboard. Many people even think that this is the only keyboard that exists.
                    </p>
                    <h3 style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Mouse</h3>
                    <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A hand-supported input device that allows users to move the cursor on the screen is a mouse. It works on a flat surface with a wheel between the left and right buttons. Laptops have a touchpad as does the function of a mouse. The invention of the mouse took place in 1063 by Douglas C. Engelbart.
                    </p>

                    <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> The earliest version of the mouse had a rollerball underneath but the modern ones are made with optical technology with a light beam. The port of the mouse connection depends on the computer and mouse type. </p>
                    <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The advantages are: </p> 
                    <ul style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
                        <li>Easy to use</li>
                        <li>Affordable</li>
                        <li>Moves the cursor faster</li>

                <!--Output Devices-->
            <h2 style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" id = "Output">Output Devices</h2>
                    <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The output devices take care of displaying the result after data processing by the input device. It may be in image, graphic, textual or audio form. These devices show the visual elements on the display.</p>
                    <h3 style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Monitor</h3>
                    <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The visual display units are the most important output device responsible for showing the visual made of pixels to the user. The pixels decide the image sharpness. There are two types of viewing screen on the monitor:
                    The pixels make up the image on the CRT display. The smaller pixels mean the image is more clear. Even a single character like ‘k’ is made of numerous pixels on the screen. A screen can have limited pixels at once, it is usually 80 by 20 characters horizontally and vertically.

                    These are high-level video devices with low volume, lightweight, and low power requirements. From wall hanging to smartwatches, they are everywhere. There are either emissive displays or non-emissive displays. Emissive displays convert electrical energy into light like LEDs in plasma panels. While the non-emissive display converts sunlight to light energy like LCDs.

                <!--Connection Devices-->
            <h2 style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" id = "Connection">Connection Devices</h2>
                    <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Because of the increasing popularity and use of the Internet, all desktop and laptop units contain built-in network interface capability. Most newer laptops also come with the ability to use wireless communications. The network interface normally uses an Ether-net protocol, and these devices offer both input and output capability. Wireless technology allows users continual connectivity while out of the office. This has revolutionized everything from allowing the police to immediately trace stolen vehicles to an on-site roofing salesperson checking stock on particular colors of roofing.
                    <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Repeater - It extends the length of the signal and allows it to transmit over the same network. In other words, it simply copies the signal bit by bit and re-generates at its original strength by operating at the physical layer.</p>
                    <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Network Hub - A network hub is a multiport repeater that connects multiple wires from different branches. It is used to transfer important data and communicate among diverse network hosts.
                        
                    Hub transfers the data as packets through a computer network. When the data processing is done from one host to another network hub, it gets transmitted to all the connected ports.  </p>

                </p>
                    <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Bridge - A bridge is a device that joins any two networks or host segments together. Its primary function in a networking architecture is to store and relay frames among the various connected segments.
                        
                        They transfer frames using the MAC or the Media Access Control. It can also prevent data crossing if the MAC addresses are wrong. Besides, it also links different physical LANs together to form a bigger logical LAN.</p>
                    <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Network Switch - Switches play a more important role than hubs. A switch is a multi-port device that enhances network efficiency. It provides limited routing information about nodes in the internal network and allows systems to connect.
                        
                        Network switches can read the hardware address of incoming data packets and transmit them to the applicable destination. A multilayer switch is a high-performance device that supports routing protocols like routers.</p>
                    <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Modem - Modems are devices that transform digital signals into the form of analog signals that are of various frequencies. Then it sends the analog signals to receivers.
                        
                        Afterward, receiver modems reverse the process and send a digital signal to linked devices like phones and laptops. Telephone companies and cable operators sometimes use modems as the end terminals to identify residential and business customers.</p>
                    <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Gateway - As the name suggests, the gateway is a passage that interlinks two networks together. It works as the messenger agent that takes data from one system, interprets it, and transfers it to another system. Gateways are also called protocol converters, and they can operate at various network layers.</p>
                    <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Access Point - First, as a regular wired network for wireless devices. Second, like a router for transferring data between different access points.
                        
                        The AP has various ports to expand the network’s size, firewall capabilities, and DHCP service. As a result, we have access points that act as a switch, DHCP server, router, and firewall.</p>

                    <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Computers can reproduce both sound and video. Material can come from standard audio compact disks but increasingly more of it is from the Internet. Users can also view and/or edit both still and digital pictures or video.</p>
                <h2 style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" id = "Storage">Storage Devices</h2>
                    <p style = "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">All computers use a hard drive to store programs and files. The size of an average hard drive is about 100 gigabytes. That size would have been considered enormous as recently as 2000. Further, changes have made the floppy disk obsolete; new computers do not come with a floppy disk drive. The newest storage device is the flash drive, which is smaller than a package of gum but can hold 1 gigabyte of storage. The hardware allowing for flash drives is also used on such devices as Sony's Memory Stick and other units that are designed to be supple-mental storage for PDAs, iPods, cameras, telephones, MP3 players, and other mobile devices.</p>
